# Prodigy-Info-Tech-Task-1
## Project Overview

This project is part of **Prodigy InfoTech – Data Science Internship (Task-01)**. The objective of this task is to create a **bar chart or histogram** to visualize the distribution of a **categorical or continuous variable** using a real-world dataset.

For this task, we used a **population dataset from the World Bank** and created visualizations to understand the distribution of population across countries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is <a href="https://github.com/kindo-tk/PRODIGY_DS_01/blob/main/worldpopulationdata.csv">world_population_dataset</a>. This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022. 

## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization



## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. **Visualization**: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. 

## Conclusion

In this task, bar charts and histograms were successfully used to visualize the distribution of both categorical
and continuous variables from the dataset. The histogram helped in understanding how population values are distributed,
revealing that most countries fall within lower population ranges,while only a few countries have extremely high populations.
Bar charts were used to compare population values across different countries and years, making it easy to identify the most 
populated countries and observe population growth trends over time.
